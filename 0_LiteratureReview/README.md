### 🔹 Source 3: [A Petri Dish for Histopathology Image Analysis (MHIST Dataset)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.12355)

- **Objective**: Present a curated dataset for colorectal polyp classification using DL.
- **Methods**: Compiled 3,152 image tiles (224×224 px) from 328 WSIs of hyperplastic polyps (HPs) and sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs), anonymized and verified for quality, classified by 7 pathologists.
- **Outcomes**: MHIST serves as a benchmark dataset for training and evaluating deep learning models in histopathology. ResNet18 tested.

  - **Training Efficiency**:
    - ResNet-18 converged in ~6 minutes using 3.5 GB memory on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU.

  - **Performance (AUC - Area Under the Curve)**:
    - **Without Pretraining**:  
      - AUC = **84.5%**
    - **With ImageNet Pretraining**:  
      - AUC = **92.7%**
      - 🔼 Improvement of **+8.2%** due to transfer learning.

  - **Effect of Annotator Agreement**:
    - Training only on high-agreement cases (e.g., "very easy", "easy"):
      - AUC = **85.1%**
    - Using all images (regardless of label certainty):
      - AUC = **84.5%**

  ✅ These results demonstrate the benefits of transfer learning and dataset curation in histopathology model performance.

- **Relation to the Project**: Provides a directly relevant dataset for developing and testing computer vision models to distinguish benign from malignant colon polyps. ...and we want to beat the baseline model performance with either our own or using ResNet50 :)
